# Cohera Prototype Fund Brief

## Briefly describe your project

Communities are as unique as the people who form them. Standard solutions such as Facebook or Slack do not meet these individual requirements because they are designed for the mass market. That's why we are developing _Cohera_: a library of software building blocks to easily build a secure, federated community platform.

The focus is on **networking across organizational boundaries**: All features are based on a federated core for sharing data and content between different platforms.

## What social challenge do you want to tackle with this project? \*

Most civil society organizations form a community focused on a common goal. To network as such, many organizations rely on platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Slack. These are geared toward mass-market features and ignore more individual needs (so-called long-tail needs).

There are collections of components geared toward corporate needs. However, none of them offer building blocks designed for community platforms. With the exception of chats, which serve as sales and support channels for companies, communities benefit little from such collections. Software tailored to the requirements of a community is rarely developed because the financial outlay is not proportional to the expected profit. What is needed here is software geared toward specific interests [\[1\]](https://gwern.net/doc/technology/2004-03-30-shirky-situatedsoftware.html)[\[2\]](https://youtu.be/qo5m92-9_QI?t=213).

Our library fills this gap and enables civil society actors to create platforms that focus on their needs. Organizations retain control over their data, can customize their platforms, and connect with each other. With reduced development costs, we offer groups the tools to develop tailor-made solutions—and create technologies with social added value.

## What similar approaches already exist, and what will make your project different or better?

Apart from proprietary platforms, HumHub is most similar to ours. However, it only allows for insufficient customization with plugins. We therefore go one level deeper and offer the individual functions as building blocks that can be freely combined and adapted. Furthermore, HumHub does not allow federation with other instances. Federated platforms such as Mastodon & Diaspora are not flexible enough for customized requirements.

There are component libraries that cater to enterprise applications. Examples include tailwindui and Ant.Design. However, they only offer components such as tables and forms. In contrast, we offer ready-to-use building blocks for community-specific functions such as discussions and events.

## Who is the target audience and how should your project reach them?

Cohera's target audience is small to medium-sized (fewer than 2,000 people) purpose-driven organizations such as associations, cooperatives, or community projects. Initial tests are being conducted with the non-profit association YoungVision e.V. (approx. 30 members) and then with other partners: Sommer inKontakt e.V. (approx. 200 people) and SuperCoop Berlin e.G. (approx. 1,800 members). We will reach other committed organizations through the German Foundation for Civic Engagement and Volunteering (DSEE) and its 100xDigital program. Targeted usability tests and close cooperation with pilot organizations ensure practical relevance, which guarantees the usability and dissemination of the software in the civil society sector in the long term.

## Final Words

We are convinced that communities are best placed to fill the gap in community platforms themselves – with tools that enable them to do so. With our experience in working with civil society organizations and our technical expertise, we are implementing this vision in the form of Cohera. We are a very well-coordinated team after 1½ years of working together.

Our motivation stems from our own experience: while attempting to build a community platform, we found that existing solutions are too limited and geared toward the lowest common denominator. They ignore the specific needs of small communities and are difficult to customize, if at all.
