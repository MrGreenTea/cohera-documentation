import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

## Quick Start

### Create a new project

Create a new Cohera project by running the following command in your terminal:

<Tabs syncKey="pkg">
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
npm create cohera@latest
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
pnpm create cohera
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Yarn">

```sh
yarn create cohera
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="bun">

```sh
bun create cohera
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

This will create a new [project directory](/guides/project-structure/) with all the necessary files and configurations for your platform.

During the setup process, you'll be prompted to select which modules to include. See [Choose your modules](#choose-your-modules) below for details on the available options.

### Choose your modules

During project creation, you'll be prompted to select which modules to include in your platform. You can select any combination of modules, or none at all to start with a minimal base.

#### Available Modules

- **[Chat](/reference/modules/chat/)** - Real-time messaging and conversations
- **[User Profiles](/reference/modules/user-profiles/)** - Member profiles and user management
- **[Posts](/reference/modules/posts/)** - Content publishing and feeds
- **[Calendar](/reference/modules/calendar/)** - Event scheduling and calendar management
- **[Map](/reference/modules/map/)** - Location-based features and geographic data
- **[Media Library](/reference/modules/media-library/)** - File uploads, storage, and media management

Use the arrow keys to navigate, space to select/deselect, and enter to confirm your choices.

:::tip
If you're not sure which modules you need, you can start with none and add them as your platform requirements become clearer.
:::

#### Modifying modules later

You can add or remove modules at any time by running:

<Tabs syncKey="pkg">
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
npx cohera module add
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
pnpm cohera module add
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Yarn">

```sh
yarn cohera module add
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="bun">

```sh
bun cohera module add
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

This will show the same module selection interface with your current selections pre-checked.

### Start the development server

When working locally, Cohera's development server lets you preview your work and automatically refreshes your browser when you make changes.

Inside your project directory, run the following command to start the development server:

<Tabs syncKey="pkg">
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
npm run dev
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
pnpm dev
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Yarn">

```sh
yarn dev
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="bun">

```sh
bun dev
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will log a message to your terminal with the URL of your local preview.
Open this URL to start using your platform.

## Next steps

Now that you have your platform running, learn more about:

- **[Project Structure](/guides/project-structure/)** - Understand how your Cohera project is organized
- **[Module Reference](/reference/modules/)** - Detailed documentation for each module
- **[Configuration](/reference/configuration/)** - Customize your platform settings
