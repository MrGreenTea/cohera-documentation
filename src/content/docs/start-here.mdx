import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

## Quick Start

### Create a new project

Create a new Cohera project by running the following command in your terminal:

<Tabs syncKey="pkg">
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
npm create cohera@latest
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
pnpm create cohera
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Yarn">

```sh
yarn create cohera
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="bun">

```sh
bun create cohera
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

This will create a new [project directory](/guides/project-structure/) with all the necessary files and configurations for your platform.

During the setup process, you'll be prompted to select which modules to include. See [Choose your modules](#choose-your-modules) below for details on the available options.

### Start the development server

When working locally, Cohera's development server lets you preview your work and automatically refreshes your browser when you make changes.

Inside your project directory, run the following command to start the development server:

<Tabs syncKey="pkg">
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
npm run dev
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
pnpm dev
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Yarn">

```sh
yarn dev
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="bun">

```sh
bun dev
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will log a message to your terminal with the URL of your local preview.
Open this URL to start using your platform.
